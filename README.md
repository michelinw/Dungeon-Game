# Introduction

Welcome to Dungeonmania, a web application developed by the cohort and staff of COMP2511 23t2 at the University of New South Wales, bringing the classic gaming experience of the 1980s into the modern era. In this project, we will explore the journey of adapting from native application dominance to the dynamic world of online gaming, focusing on object oriented backend development using Java.

# Project Overview

## Aim

The primary aim of this project is to transform the traditional Dungeonmania game into a web application, aligning with the evolving preferences of the new generation of gamers.

## Objectives

1. Acclimatize to the existing codebase
2. Analyze the code, identifying Design Patterns and potential improvements
3. Refactor the code to enhance design quality, incorporating course-discussed Design Patterns
4. Extend the codebase to introduce new and exciting functionality

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Codebase analysis and understanding
2. Design pattern recognition and implementation
3. Code refactoring for improved design
4. Collaborative development and feature extension

# Stages of Development

## Stage 1: Codebase Acclimatization
In this phase, we familiarize ourselves with the existing Dungeonmania codebase. We will delve into the intricacies, identifying existing Design Patterns and potential areas for improvement.

## Stage 2: Code Analysis and Refactoring
Here, we conduct a thorough analysis of the code, addressing any Design Patterns that could enhance its quality. The focus is on refactoring to achieve a more robust and maintainable design.

## Stage 3: Feature Extension
Building upon the refined codebase, we extend Dungeonmania to introduce new features that enhance the gaming experience. This phase showcases our ability to integrate new functionality seamlessly.
